It was an afternoon in the late summer of 1899. As soon as Anton Vogel stepped foot inside his house, he could sense that something was off. As he walked along the narrow corridor, he could almost hear his piano playing. Puzzled, he stepped closer, and he could hear it now: It was Mozart's piano sonata in D major.

He drew his wand and walked quietly to the drawing room where the piano was placed. His suspicion was confirmed when he caught sight of a young man from behind – Gellert, his friend who had disappeared all summer after leaving school, or to put it more precisely, his expulsion. His hair has grown quite a bit, golden curls spreading over the back of his pearl-white shirt, and his shoulders somehow seemed to grow boarder, too, flexing and relaxing with the music he was playing.

He seemed so devoted that Anton couldn’t bear to interrupt. He put away his wand and stood at a distance behind him, listening quietly. Gellert must have noticed him. The boy had always been overly perceptive – a sense of magical aura, as Anton liked to define it. Anton couldn’t help but let the corner of his mouth curl up. He raised his right hand in the air, and with a magical hand movement, hit the keys, filling in a few treble notes. Gellert knowingly withdrew his right hand, allowing Anton to play with him. It seemed that several months’ separation had not broken the tacit understanding between them.

When the song was over, Anton teased softly, "I thought you didn’t like to play the works of other composers." Let alone Muggle composers, he thought to himself.

Gellert didn't respond right away, which was already unusual. Moments later, he turned to face Anton. With a grin, he said, "Long time no see, Anton," he waved his hand tensely. "May I... stay at your place for a while?"

Slightly stunned, Anton stared at him up and down. Gellert looked a little different, though he couldn’t immediately point to what exactly. His smile was flawless.

Anton came to stand by his side, leaning on the piano, while patting his friend's shoulder. "Of course," he replied without hesitation. He darted a look at the boy’s neck where, exposed by the low-necked shirt, a shiny necklace caught his eye. His gaze lingered on it for a moment, until he added with a warm smile, "Otherwise, who else could make the lonely piano here sing so beautifully?"

*

Gellert told Anton that his magic would fail from time to time, and he would leave him in peace as soon as he recovered. Anton didn't believe it at first, thinking it was some poor excuse he felt the need to make up for some reason. Gellert had always had seemingly inexhaustible energy and creativity. Magic was as natural to him as breathing, just some malleable clay in his hands with infinite possibilities.

He couldn’t imagine what someone so gifted by heaven would be like stripped of his magic. In fact, Gellert really didn’t seem any different other than avoiding using magic. He was just quieter, more withdrawn, spending more time contemplating and napping. He did seem to be – as he put it – trying to restore his energy and regain his magic.

On a sunny day, Gellert would lie sideways in the armchair, resting his legs on the armrests and picking up the pendant he wore all the time towards the sunlight. He would observe, or as it seemed, admire it for a long time. Most of the times, Anton just watched him from a distance. He could almost hear Gellert’s mind at work, the memories spinning around, but he never did know what was inside this young wizard’s brilliant mind. And he seldom asked. He’d wait patiently, content with the few words the golden-haired boy was willing to gift him when he was in the mood.

Anton knew him like no one else – his way of doing things, of thinking, something they learned since they were nothing but fledglings.

Gellert had come to Durmstrang in Year 3. For some reason, he transferred to public school from homeschooling. Even before the "initiation" that any transfer student must go through had reached completion, this mysterious foreign boy had taken Anton’s first place in their class. Astonishment and jealousy were smoldering in his heart. This was a feeling he had never possessed before, and he didn't like it.

Soon enough, Anton had to admit that Gellert was better than him in almost every subject. He desperately needed to save himself from a whirlpool of jealousy. And one day, when he found himself standing by the boy’s side, confronting the seniors who were bullying him, he finally found his antidote: instead of what he had been feeling, he could love him and cherish him; he could care for him like he was a part of his own being.

The closer they got, the more clearly he saw that this man had unlimited potential, and with an attitude that bordered on paranoia, he held on to what he wanted – or, rather, resisted what he knew he absolutely didn't want.

<i>We should stand in the light. We must make changes</i> – young voices spoke of grand ideals – <i>Not for someone else, not for the future, but now; it has to be us, has to be me.</i>

*

"It's fixed!" Gellert, who was lying on the couch, held the parchment up high. After having it be Accio’ed by Anton, he again buried his head in the books that Anton had picked for him from his family library.

To help Gellert regain his vigor, Anton tried every means to find things he could do, even handing over his own job application to the German Ministry of Magic.

The parchment that was handed back was covered with countless redactions and harsh comments. Upon reading it, Anton could feel his palms sweat. But when he calmed down and delved into the revision process, the revised draft was indeed much more convincing – although it contained some degree of shameless exaggeration.

"Thank you..." He was about to say some nice words when he caught Gellert raising his right hand while staring at the book, lost in thought. Judging from the direction of his fingers, he was planning to summon the coffee mug on the side table. However, the cup sat on the table, unresponsive. Gellert raised his eyes, seemed confused for a second, and then, as if remembering something, he retracted his hand, embarrassed.

The pain that flashed in his eyes did not escape Anton's notice. With a sigh, Anton called the cup into his hands, and sat on the couch next to Gellert.

"Don’t you plan on talking to me sometime? About what happened to you this summer?" He handed Gellert the cup, trying not to let sympathy slip into his voice. Gellert wouldn't like that.

Seeing that the young wizard fell silent, he continued, "It has something to do with the person who gave you this necklace, right?"

He never wanted to force Gellert to speak, but he knew that if he didn't, the wound might never heal, and he couldn't bear to see someone who was meant to shine so brightly look so dejected.

Gellert shook his head no. "It's my fault." He avoided Anton's concerned gaze and looked down at his own hands.

Anton had a personal understanding of the loss of magic. After his father left home, his mother had lost her magic for quite some time. Those were dark days, and he wasn't sure if his mother would choose life if not for him.

"Thank you, Anton, for taking me in." Gellert rarely said thanks, and at this moment, he looked especially sincere. Anton noticed his fingers trembling slightly.

"Of course," he blurted out. It was hard for him to imagine any circumstances where he would turn him away.

There was a hint of hesitation on Gellert's face. "What am I to you?" he asked lightly.

This question caught Anton off guard, but he quickly brought up a smile and said teasingly, "A dropout." His smile grew bolder, now changing into a more serious tone. "But I’ve heard that those who change the world are all dropouts.”

Gellert laughed softly, although Anton could sense the bitterness within. "You love me. That's why you think so. "

Anton was taken aback for a moment. Probably only Gellert would speak of love all so casually like that, but he didn't deny it. He just subtly swapped the pronouns for something more general. "You got that backwards. People think so. That’s why they love you."

These words made Gellert raise his head sharply and look into Anton’s eyes, as if he was seeing him for the first time. "You think so?"

"Oh, I’m quite sure. "

*

Gellert was getting better day by day – not only his mood and spirit, but also his magic. He never experimented or practiced in front of Anton. Instead, he just used magic every now and then, and basked in Anton's surprised look.

He began to work on his manifesto and put his plans in writing. Occasionally Anton would be allowed to provide advice, although he wasn’t sure how much of that humble attitude was sincere and how much was just for show.

In any case, he was pleased that his piano was singing again – this time, with Gellert's original works. In his spare time aside from all the books and scrolls, he devoted his energy to music, pouring his creativity into the dance of notes.

"Does she know that you play and compose?" Anton asked in a casual tone, leaning against the piano.

"No," Gellert mumbled, biting his pen and studying the manuscript, before correcting him. "<i>He</i> doesn't."

Anton's eyes followed the pendant around Gellert's neck, which would sway slightly with the movements of the young performer, reflecting colorful rays of light in the sun. His eyes darkened at that.

And Gellert seemed to have seen through him. He didn't stop playing, but added with a half-smile on his lips, "But who really knows who?" he concluded his performance with a glissando and looked up at Anton. "If really seen, who would still be loved?" 

To that, Anton didn't reply, but he was looking forward to the day when he could truly see him. That’s when he would use himself as a counterexample and laugh at the man who liked to generalize about almost everything.

*

After Gellert’s departure, the house fell silent once again. Fortunately, Anton was busy enough after being admitted to the German Ministry of Magic as a trainee.

From time to time, he would receive a letter from Gellert. Those light yellow envelopes never indicated the sender address – just Anton’s name in Gellert's handwriting, with the tail of the "g" curling up high, always ending with a confident dot.

Troubling news began to circulate, rumors spreading quietly. When his colleagues whispered to one another, Anton occasionally listened, but rarely took part. He was content with a secret, and he was an insider, which was enough.

Finally, Grindelwald's name appeared in the newspapers. It’d disappear for a while, until the news of another infiltration or terrorist act shocked the wizarding world again.

Then, for ten months in a row, Anton did not receive any message from his secret friend, while his own work in the Auror office was going surprisingly well. "Capturing Grindelwald" was always the top priority that no one had ventured to accomplish in earnest. In fact, Anton might be the person who was most committed to this matter. He did his best collecting information, all the while fearing the prospect of encountering a particular piece of information – until the day the familiar envelope fell on his desk again, along with a package.

He breathed deeply in a futile attempt to tame his racing heart. Neatly slitting open the envelope, he carefully took out the letter.

"You look astoundingly kitsch, sehr geehrte Leiter der Aurorenzentrale." He could almost hear Gellert's theatrical teasing voice ringing in his ears, and he looked around nervously. Gellert would put his contact in the Ministry; he had expected that much. But he didn’t expect to have someone – if not Gellert himself – this close to him.

"Put on this suit and come to me," he wrote.

Anton tapped his wand on top of the package, in which a suit of burgundy velvet did indeed lie. After putting it on, he couldn’t help but feel his cheeks get warm, not because of the gratitude, but surprise at how perfectly it fitted. He immediately felt the need to investigate every single person around him, although it was probably already too late.

"The button at the very bottom is the Portkey," the letter instructed.

*

Anton Apparated in the front yard of a grim stronghold that almost seemed out of place in the vast mountain range. Fortunately, the journey was not far. He must still be somewhere in the hinterland of Europe. The sudden drop in temperature, however, caught him off guard. He raised his head, peering at the towering spire through the howling blizzard. Surrounded by snow-capped mountains, at such an altitude... was he on the Alps?

"This outfit does suit you well." Standing right inside the wicket gate was Gellert, with a signature smug smile on his face – of course he wouldn't step into the snow.

In big strides, Anton walked inside, rubbing his hands for some semblance of warmth. "Why on earth didn't you set the Portkey destination indoors?"

"How would you admire the majestic exterior of my castle that way?" stated his old friend as a matter of course.

With a quiet sigh, Anton rolled his eyes. "<i>Your</i> castle?" he noted.

"Nurmengard is the name." With a wave of his hands, Gellert lit up the giant wrought iron chandelier in the vestibule, and continued with a triumphant tone. "I named it; I built it; <i>mine</i>." In a graceful gesture, he bowed and raised his hand, and said, "If you would allow me to show you around?"

They walked down the hallway covered by velvet carpet, past the grand drawing room with imposing floor-to-ceiling windows and spiral staircases leading to the top of the tower, but Gellert didn't seem interested in taking him there. They stayed in the study for a long time. The walls were lined with bookshelves, and there were exquisite portraits of Greek prophets covering all the empty spaces. The uniform dark tones made the whole space look solemn and elegant. Gellert went on and on with the stories behind all his collections. This man always had a strong interest in ancient legends and mysterious folklores, and now it seemed that he was finally able to house those dreams.

Eventually, the young lord of the castle relented, concluding their tour with a sumptuous dinner. At the dinner, Anton met with several of Gellert's followers, and this place called <i>Numengard</i> seemed to have indeed become their base. With others around, he couldn't ask too many questions. Anton contemplated the possibility that the crooked wizard had done it on purpose.

When the dinner was over, Gellert led him back to the vestibule, and Anton had to admit that he was a little disappointed.

"Have you had a good time tonight?" Gellert asked, leaning against the frame of the gate. Once young and delicate, the wizard standing in front of him now had firm, broad shoulders contained in an elegant his black tuxedo, a magnificent fortress under his name, a brewing revolution awaiting his leadership – yet he was still a wanted man, Anton reminded himself.

At this moment, there was finally no one else around, and he hurried to speak in a lowered voice. "You have to be very careful, especially lately." The Ministry of Magic might well be slow and bureaucratic, but it could turn out to be quite a stubborn tail to lose.

"Oh, I <i>am</i> careful." At a casual pace, Gellert tapped his wand at the palm of his hand, and only now did Anton notice the wand he was holding was new and in a remarkable shape. 

"Which is why I have to remove a part of your memory of tonight."

"What?"

"Don't worry, every visitor to Nurmengard gets their memories altered, " Gellert said flatly. "To ensure that no outsider knows where my headquarters are."

Anton had to admit that the phrase "outsider" caused him more pain than the actual threat of having his memories tampered with. He raised an eyebrow in disbelief. "Then why did you invite people over in the first place?"

Gellert smiled. "They'll still remember the name <i>Nurmengard</i>, along with its grandeur, its beauty, its indestructible quality, in association with a man named <i>Grindelwald</i>."

Anton stared at him then, his eyes wandering to Gellert’s chest inadvertently, and something painfully familiar nesting in his left pocket attracted his attention. Was it an ordinary brooch? No, it wasn’t. It was the pendant... the token of love – supposedly – that he had seen many years ago.

"But I'm special, aren't I?" said Anton, slowly stressing each syllable. "You trust me."

"It depends." Gellert raised the corner of his mouth.

“Drop it, Gellert!" he raised his voice half amused, half reproachful. "If you wanted to erase my memory, you would have done so already. If what you want is me swearing allegiance to you, then I —"

"Will you?" Gellert interrupted, tilting his head up with a piercing look that seemed to see through him.

Anton paused; a breath stuck in his chest. Was this man really oblivious, or was he pretending to be so? He looked overly confident, triumphant even, but his eyes were full of expectations, as if no one in the whole world had reasons to disappoint him.

Anton's eyes wandered between Gellert’s lips and eyes, and he just cocked his head; Anton took a step closer, taking a deep breath, and he didn't retreat; Anton leaned over and gave those mischievous lips a feather-light kiss, and he was not repulsed.

After a second or two, Anton took a step back. He watched Gellert lick his lower lip swiftly and continued to wait for his reply with an inscrutable smile tugging at the corner of his mouth, as if nothing earthshaking had just happened.

"So, Lord of Nurmengard." He looked into those wonderous heterochromatic eyes, pleading softly, "would you allow me to keep the memory of this kiss?"

*

One night in the early summer of 1927, Anton opened the door as usual and stepped into the living room. He was startled by the sound of running water from his bathroom. The water stopped the moment he pulled out his wand. A few seconds later, a man wrapped in a bath towel walked out of the bathroom.

Anton aimed his wand at him in a split second, but the man just stood still with his hands raised in a placating gesture. He asked, "May I... get dressed?"

It was the necklace on his neck that Anton first recognized, and then the identity of the intruder – it was Gellert, whose features were obscured by the light coming from behind. Merlin! There would come a day when this habitual burglar would scare him to death. How could he recognize him with this beard and long hair!

"Gellert!" he called out, and immediately lowered his voice, "why are you here?!"

"I thought you had been notified that I was planning an escape?" Gellert half-sat on the arm of the couch, looking up at him.

"But you didn't say you would come to me! Are you sure it's a good idea for a fugitive who runs faster than the news to show up in the house of the current Minister of Magic?" If this man again answered him with <i>the most dangerous place is the safest</i>, he would definitely drop his manners and proceed with a giant eyeroll. "Also, how do you know my wife is not at home?" he added.

"I thought you'd be happy to see me," Gellert sighed pretentiously. "I just wanted to talk to you about something. Seeing as it's not convenient for you..." He stood up and made to go.

"Wait." Anton stopped the man wearing nothing but a bath towel with resigned amusement.

He dug out some of his own clothes and handed them to Gellert, watching him cover his body piece by piece. Anton noticed some new scars on his shoulders and across his back. After six months in prison, the blond man looked thinner than he had remembered, and his clothes seemed too baggy on him.

Gellert rolled up his overly long sleeves and nodded with satisfaction. "Thanks. I was going to ask about the current conditions at Nurmengard, but as the new recruits I sent back haven't complained yet, it seems like you did a good job."

New recruits? Surprised, Anton raised his eyebrows. Gellert might be the only one who could escape from the MACUSA prison while gaining supporters along the way.

"… Then the other matters can wait. I won't bother you any longer. " He started walking outside again.

Anton did roll his eyes then, tired of Gellert playing hard to get.

"Stay." He paused, searching for the appropriate phrases. "If you go back like this, none of your followers would recognize you. Let me take care of that for you."

*

Anton stood behind Gellert, resting his head on the back of the armchair with one hand on his chin. He smoothed a stray lock of hair behind Gellert’s ear, which had grown too long during his jailtime. With a shiny razor in his hand, he carefully shaved his beard to reveal a sharp jawline. He didn't ask Gellert about his preference. He simply chose a style that framed those angular cheeks of the other according to his own idea.

"I didn't know you had this skill," said Gellert, leaning into the chair with his eyes closed. Anton felt the unwanted effect of this act of trust on him.

"There are so many things that you don't know, and besides –" he carefully trimmed the mustache at the corner of Gellert’s lower lip, adding, "it's best to handle everything on your own at a time like this."

His other hand was resting on the side of Gellert's neck, and he could feel the pulse throbbing beneath his thumb. How much he had worried that this rhythm would end at some point he didn't even know about, that this warmth would fade in some foreign country, would this man never know. During the months of his captivity that felt like years, all Anton could do was to gradually turn his faith into superstition, and he would not tell him anything about it. All he said was, "It seems that you had some bad luck with the MACUSA."

"I was only one step away – if it weren't for that British magizoologist messing around." Gellert clicked his tongue irritably. He seemed lost in thought, his fingers tracing the lines on the delicate vial-shaped pendant resting on his chest.

"Newt Scamander." Anton recalled the appearance of the man in the papers. "You think it is Dumbledore who’s behind him." He whispered the name, watching Gellert close his fingers around the pendant.

"Our nemesis, yes," he agreed, and then the corner of his mouth twitched again. "But it was all going well until the disguise was uncovered. You should see the way Picquery looked at me." He smiled, reaching out to wrap one of his arms around Anton’s neck. Icy fingers made Anton shudder. "It seems that you are not the only one who fell for one’s subordinates. Is your married life still happy?" he asked teasingly, eyes remaining closed.

"Gellert!" Anton froze. "Look at me."

For a brief second, he had a trace of concern, but soon, Gellert opened his eyes obediently, and those heterochromatic eyes looked at him languidly. A drop of water rolled from the ends of his overly long hair into the crook of his neck and slipped down along the silver chain around his neck before disappearing.

Anton swallowed. He probed into the mind of the other man almost subconsciously. He didn't realize his folly until he unsurprisingly hit a solid barrier of Occlumency.

"Don't be a fool, Anton." The way Gellert murmured his name was almost gentle. "Ask me if you have questions."

Countless questions had swirled around in his head for too long, but when the time came, he found it difficult to open up. "This is a blood pact, isn't it?" he asked, staring at the vial in Gellert's hand.

"That would be correct," Gellert answered matter-of-factly. Anton was a little taken aback by his frankness.

"And whose blood is contained within?"

"Mine, and Dumbledore's." This was the answer he expected.

"I'm assuming that's why you can't move against him?" Anton tried to calm his voice.

"Yes. Nor him against me," he said with a genuine tone, and the same sincerity flared in his eyes. "So, this won't change anything, Anton, and won't get in the way of our plans. To me, he's just a mis— a trouble, a shackled beast, and a threat that’s being contained."

Even now, right this moment, face to face, and eye to eye, this man was lying to him. No one would willingly carry shackles for decades.

"But you want him to be by your side," he blurted out – <i>not me</i>, barely managing to swallow the second half of the sentence.

Gellert paused, and then the pressure his arm put against Anton's neck suddenly increased, forcing him to lean over to him. "No one," he said decisively, "no one is better suited to stand by my side than you, Anton. Don't listen to any nonsense from anyone."

Perhaps he would rather believe his lies, Anton thought. After all, this man who was born for glory and greatness would never belong to anyone, which was something he had known for a long time and would never try to change. He sighed softly.

"I need you to concentrate, Gellert. Your prophecy is coming true," Anton said slowly, looking away. "Muggles are doing more and more terrible things to some of their own kind. I'm afraid... that we will suffer the same fate soon."

Gellert's eyes darkened for a second and immediately lit up again. "Knowing the fear, my dear friend," he said, rolling over in the armchair to face him, nearly bumping into the razor in Anton's hand, "—is a good thing, a good sign!" He brushed his long hair backward, his eyes flashing with excitement, "I shall stand in the light. I shall not be satisfied with scuttering around in the shadows. Same goes for all witches and wizards."

Anton stared at his face that was no longer young, watching it light up with the same look as when he was only a teenager, hearing him voicing the same words – only this time, they could really be brought into reality.

"I need to organize more rallies, starting from Paris." He grabbed Anton's wrist. "Help me, Anton. You know we can."

*

The name Dumbledore had only recently been gaining traction, following the publication of the article presumably related to dragon blood and stealing the obsolete Nicolas Flamel’s thunder.

Anton spent more time investigating this man than he had expected, but the more he investigated, the more confused he became: a British professor, who had been hiding in that remote old castle all year round, devoted himself to researching some obscure fields, put up a hypocritic, conservative mask everywhere he went, and seemed quite interested in Muggles.

He picked up the newspapers at hand. Gellert's “wanted” notice was printed on the front page, and he grinned shamelessly at him. Anton rolled his eyes, folded the page in half, and Dumbledore's name was printed in the right corner of the lower half. He tried to imagine them together: Gellert with his unbridled iron-blooded style, and then Dumbledore with his cautious scholarly temperament. Anton shook his head. At least for now, he didn't have to solve the mystery. As he couldn't see any chance of them crossing paths, he just wished that he could avoid seeing this name as much as possible.

However, his inner peace was broken all too soon. Dumbledore began to directly and indirectly write to the German Ministry of Magic and to him, asking about the progress of the pursuit of Grindelwald and the preparations for the election of the next Supreme Mugwump, questioning his role in it between the lines. He had to acknowledge the man's acumen. It seemed that he had to modify his previous opinions of him. 

Then, he thought, no matter how many secret connections Gellert had with him, at least Nurmengard was free of his influence. Gellert wouldn’t dare act so blatantly. Perhaps he had also considered the possibility that it would have been a matter of time before this so-called "nemesis" visited Nurmengard. But in any case, he did not expect this to happen so quickly and in this manner.

In May of 1929, because of his official position, the news of Gellert's disappearance circled through several contact people before it finally reached him. He quickly directed a group of followers to search all the places where conflicts had broken out on the streets of Berlin.

Interfering in Muggle government affairs was necessary, Anton agreed, but violating an explicit curfew, taking to the streets, and intensifying conflicts in this way, was what he had always tried to dissuade Gellert from. Of course, Gellert would not listen to him. He had to "show the brutality of the authorities" and to "meet the muzzles of the government stooges as martyrs," and he even had to do it himself.

The gunfire in the streets continued all night, and Anton searched all night. It was nearly dawn when he was finally informed that Gellert had returned to Nurmengard.

He listened carefully to the Healer’s report, and what Ms. Nagel said about Gellert's strange escort caught his attention. She had never seen that middle-aged man in Nurmengard, who didn't know much German, with a British accent, dressed in strange attire but acting gently. The man left after the operation.

Anton clenched his teeth and nodded. After thanking Nagel, he brought the potion to Gellert's bedroom.

"How are you feeling?" He sat down on the edge of the bed, trying to keep his voice as soft as possible.

Gellert, half lying on the pillows, snorted. He opened one eye and looked at Anton. "Don't talk. I know you want to blame me, or worse yet –" he still had the heart to tease, "to pity me."

Anton lowered his head and lifted the corner of the blanket, checking the bandage wrapped around Gellert's shoulders and abdomen, and then looked away again. He blinked forcibly, feeling especially tired. "It was Dumbledore who rescued you?" He braced himself and asked calmly. Dumbledore was a name that Gellert had become increasingly reluctant to mention in recent years, the reaction to which could be anger, prevarication, denial, or escape. But now, at least, the bedridden wizard had little choice but to listen.

As expected, Gellert pouted. "I don't want to talk about him."

But Anton did not intend to give up. "Your blood pact is gone, but I don’t see you worry." He stared into the other's eyes solemnly. "Because it's with him, correct?"

"I said I don't want to talk about it!" He tried to sit up but failed to because of his wounds. He fell back hard, gasping for air with a pained look on his face.

Anton’s frown deepened. "I'm sorry, Gellert, but there's something I have to say." He put his hand through Gellert's hair, casting a relaxation spell, which was useless since the man wouldn't allow him access to his brain. He couldn't help him with the pain. "We're at a critical juncture right now, and I, the head of the International Confederation of Wizards – and countless others, are trying to clear your name because, in short, I don't want to hand the world to anyone but you." He searched Gellert's gaze. "We can't afford to take a wrong step. We can't raise doubts. Your association with Dumbledore, if known to your followers, will send the wrong signal. I think you know that too..."

"Association... Who do you think is the 'correct' one to be associated with me, huh?" Gellert's breath was still unsteady, but his tone was fierce. "You?" Clenching his jaw, Anton thought he would back down, but he didn't.

"No one," he said at last, saying each word in a begrudging way. "What you say and what you represent must be above you, Gellert. Above you, above everyone, until no one can ever hold a candle to you. You, the chosen one. Only then can there be a glimmer of hope for our cause.”

*

Obviously, his words made a difference, but Anton was not sure whether it had changed for the better or worse.

On the bright side, Gellert was now highly motivated, announcing new ideas almost every day. Sometimes he would put a disguising spell on himself and stay in Anton’s office or apartment for days.

But his enthusiasm also kept him awake. It was not a big deal that he interrupted Anton's work from time to time, but it seemed he almost gave up sleep, which worried Anton quite a bit. He sometimes felt that Gellert was terrified of sleep.

"Do we have to let that magical creature with a strange name choose the next Supreme Mugwump?" Gellert interrupted Anton's train of thought for the umpteenth time. Just replying to the opposing voices against Gellert's exoneration was enough to give him a headache. "I'm sure that as long as I am allowed to stand, the public will naturally choose my side."

"Every time a Qilin is born, a righteous leader will rise to power," Anton said, restating his answer without looking up. "Humans need a little mythical aura – you are no exception."

"But I..."

"I want them to see you as I see you, Gellert," interrupted Anton, looking up directly into his eyes. "Humans are fallible. Whichever being is ushered to the top by ‘humans’ can also be easily pulled down." He recalled his own situation, the corner of his mouth twitching. "However, being chosen by a 'sacred messenger' would be something else. What you have to win is beyond this election."

"Alright... but it must be me who picks the team to go catch Qilin."

"I think what you wanted to say was ‘invite’." Anton rubbed his forehead. "Anyway, I'll think about it – if you're willing to get some sleep." During the whole time they spent together, he had never seen this man have a good rest.

Looking at the hesitation on the other's face, he added, "My bed is very comfortable."

"I know."

*

Anton heard a quiet mutter beside him, which made the pen in his hand pause. Then, the breathing of the man next to him calmed down again. The soothing rhythm gradually dissolved Anton’s tension.

He tilted his head to look at his bed, seeing Gellert curled up on his side in a blanket, shoulders heaving with even breathing. He was lying facing the desk and didn't seem to mind the candlelight flickering on his face.

Anton realized that he had been staring at him for too long. Hurriedly, he pulled his eyes back to the page in front of him, brushed his own hair with one hand, and propped his head on his side. He sighed, not sure how he had gotten himself in this situation: staying up in the middle of the night, racking his brains to draft the announcement of exoneration for a criminal most wanted all over the world, with said criminal soundly asleep steps away from him. He hadn't used the small desk in his bedroom for a long time, but at Gellert’s silent request, he had no choice but to carry all his documents into the bedroom.

But the calm of the night did not last long. A gasp beside him made him turn his head sharply, only to see Gellert with face flushed, an expression mixed with pain and panic, his chest heaving violently. He was gasping for air but still made choking sounds as if he was drowning. He supported the weight of half his body on his forearm and scratched the skin around his neck with his other hand – even though there was nothing there.

"Gellert!" Anton rushed forward, putting one arm around the other’s shoulders and lifting his chin in a panic to make sure his airway was unobstructed.

What was hurting him?

Gellert’s fingernails sank into his skin, scratching out a blood mark. Anton hurriedly grabbed his hand to keep him from hurting himself, but he was trembling all over, as if he was at the brink of death. Everything was happening too quickly. Just when Anton was thinking about whether to leave him temporarily and call for help, the seemingly dying man in his arms suddenly relaxed. The suffocating whimper was replaced by a rapid gasp, and shimmering lights returned to his eyes.

Only then did Anton realize how fast his heartbeat had been. He slowly lowered Gellert's upper body back onto the mattress, feeling his own fingers trembling. "What happened?" he asked.

Gellert closed his eyes and fell silent for such a long time that Anton thought this was another of those questions that he didn't intend to answer. But then, he spoke up, "It's the blood pact." He opened his eyes, and Anton couldn’t read his expression hidden in the shadows. "It's punishing me, punishing us," he said slowly.

A rage came over Anton. "Is there any way to avoid it?" he growled. This would be a big issue, but at the same time he cared about another question. "Does Dumbledore know that this is hurting you?" This time, Anton was in no mood to care whether Gellert would be offended with him bringing up that name. If this weakness could be exploited at Dumbledore’s will, then they would have to change their strategy.

Fortunately, Gellert didn't seem to be trying to dodge the question this time. He considered it seriously, and then said softly, "He doesn't know, I think." His face was overcast only for a moment. When the moment had passed, the corner of his mouth curled up again. He turned to face Anton. "No need to worry. We have more important things to think about than this. It won't alter our destiny, which will be fulfilled sooner or later."

"You’ve foreseen it?" Anton gasped.

"Countless times."

Anton swallowed. He couldn't imagine the life of a prophet – maybe no one could. He had read stories about many prophets of the past, about how the world turned them away, not willing to believe in what they said about the future. So most of them were content to record those trivial details in writing, waiting for future generations to verify them as some meaningless vindication. In his arms, however, was a true hero who stole fire from the gods and vowed to correct the wrongs in the world of the living.

"Anton..." the call brought him back to reality, and he looked down at Gellert. "Let me ask you. If... we continue to strive to stop the Nazis, stop the coming war, uphold wizarding rights, without... overthrowing the Statute of Wizarding Secrecy─" Gellert propped himself up and continued in a tentative tone, which was quite rare. "─So that we won't be fighting a war on every front. After all, we are in the minority..."

"You want to give up the very first principle of your manifesto?!" Anton interrupted him in disbelief. "We either have our freedom or we don’t. There is no middle ground. Your followers are willing to sacrifice their lives for you, for your path to power and glory, and do you know why? Because they’ve lost their families, their loved ones in the Muggle war. Because they were gagged, blindfolded, and shackled by their own kind. It was you who gave them hope. You know all that. Do you need me to repeat it for you from beginning to end?"

Gellert pursed his lips and did not speak for a long while. Finally, he said simply, "This was just a random thought."

Anton sighed to himself. "You need a good rest," he decided, standing up from the bed. "I'll go get you some sleeping potion."

He felt Gellert's grip on his wrist tighten slightly when he got up, but he quickly let him go, as if it was unintentional. Anton comforted him, "I know, I know. But you are absolutely safe with me tonight. You can take your potion with confidence." With that said, he got up and left.

"Sometimes..." When Anton walked to the door, a voice behind him stopped him again.

He turned and saw Gellert half-seated on the bed, his head bowed, his face in the shadows cast by his limp strands of hair.

"Many times, I dreamed that I was standing on top of a pile of ruins, with no one around but everlasting silence." He paused, then looked up and gave Anton a weak smile. "Do you know how it feels... to be all alone?"

This question surprised Anton for a moment, but he had had the answer long ago. "That's because you didn't listen carefully," he replied. "Otherwise, you would hear footsteps behind you – hundreds of thousands of them. You couldn't see them because they were behind you, trusting you, following you, supporting you," he said, watching Gellert's eyes gradually light up with each word. "We belong to the future."

“Für das größere Wohl.”
