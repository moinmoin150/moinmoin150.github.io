Using pattern recognition, I have identified an extended list of unofficial names that the commenters to Gateway Pundit articles used to describe Democrats. This list may not be exhaustive but only include those are associated with demon (containing “demon” as a word part), vermin (containing “rat” as a word part), Fascism/Communism (containing “fasci,” “nazi,” “comm,”  “卐,” “marx,” or “china” as a word part), Racism (replacing “c” with “k” including kkk, or containing “dix” as a word part), and generally disparaging terms (containing “dum,” “donkey,” “dim,” “tard,” or “dingbat” as a word part).
